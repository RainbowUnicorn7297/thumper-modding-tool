## Installation

## Getting Started
* Run "Thumper Modding Tool.exe" and select Thumper folder for first time setup.

* Click Turn OFF Mod Mode button to restore the original levels and your save data.
* To edit the custom levels, open and edit the .txt files under the levels folder. Click Update Custom Levels button to commit any edits you have made.

## Editing Custom Levels
* Each custom level must contain the level config file (config_*\<level name\>*.txt) and .xfm Object file (xfm_*\<level name\>*.txt).
* The templates folder contains objects from the original levels. They can be copied and used in the custom levels, as long as the object names (obj_name) are not duplicated.
* The examples folder contains examples showcasing how various objects can be defined and used in a custom level.
